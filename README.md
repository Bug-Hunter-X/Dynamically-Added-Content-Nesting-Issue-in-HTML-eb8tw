# Dynamically Added Content Nesting Issue in HTML

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue in HTML related to the dynamic addition of content and how its nesting can impact rendering and layout.  Incorrectly nested dynamically added content can lead to unforeseen consequences and styling problems.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains HTML code with a dynamically added paragraph element.  The unexpected behavior occurs due to the lack of proper structuring when adding the paragraph using innerHTML.  This can cause issues with CSS styling and proper document layout, potentially affecting accessibility and user experience.

## Solution

The `solution.html` file demonstrates a better approach to resolving this issue using DOM manipulation methods such as `createElement` and `appendChild`. This method provides better control over the structure and positioning of the added content.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the rendering of the dynamically added paragraph. The layout might not be as expected, due to incorrect nesting.

## How to test the solution
1. Open `solution.html` in a web browser.
2. Compare the rendering with `bug.html`. The solution offers more precise control and structured way of adding elements, leading to expected behavior.
